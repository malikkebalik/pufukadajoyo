Even I, the lady who is no stranger to <a href=# class=T3D>weird celebrity beauty tricks</a> and once shaved her legs with peanut butter in the name of journalism, wonder if sometimes celebrities go too far.</p><p>That being said, I also know that some of of the <a href=# class=T3D>beauty hacks that sound the weirdest</a> actually work the best. When someone finds something that works for them, it's worthwhile to stick with it, even if it's pretty unconventional or sounds totally off-putting. I also trust that celebrities, especially actors and models who get their hair regularly coiffed and makeup regularly applied, have a little more insight into the tips and tricks of professionals than I do.</p><p>Despite my optimistic attitude, there are certainly some celebrity endorsed beauty tricks that are too over-the-top for me, or just too expensive. What doesn't work for me might be exactly what someone else needs, though, so here are 11 celebrities with some wacky beauty routines that might work for you if you're willing to get over the weird factor and give them a shot.</p><h3>1. Shailene Woodley's Sunbathing Vagina</h3><figure class="Qf5 nbP" readability=2><p>FREDERIC J. BROWN/AFP/Getty Images</p></figure><p>From using <a href=# class=T3D>beet juice as a lip stain</a> to <a href=# class=T3D>eating clay</a>, Shailene Woodley definitely swears by some of the funkiest, all-natural beauty tricks out there. Perhaps the most illuminating one, however, came when Woodley told Into The Gloss that she <a href=# class=T3D>sunbathes her vagina</a> to prevent yeast infections. The vitamin D apparently helps make your lady bits feel more energized. So, in Woodley's words, "When the sun finally comes out, spread your legs and get some sunshine."</p><h3>2. Kim Kardashian's Vampire Facial</h3><p>A now-iconic moment from <i>Kim And Kourtney Take Miami </i>was when <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Kim Kardashian got a Vampire Facelift</a>, letting the camera crew film the whole cringeworthy time. This treatment takes blood from a patient's arm, runs it through a centrifuge to get the plasma, and then injects the plasma back into the skin with lots and lots of needles to stimulate collagen production. It also costs $1,500 per treatment, and looks incredibly painful. There's clearly something there, though, because few months later, <a href=# class=T3D>Bar Rafaeli got the same blood-based treatment</a> and posted an equally shocking selfie.</p><h3>3. Snooki's Cat Litter Exfoliant</h3><figure class="Qf5 nbP" readability=2><p>Jamie McCarthy/Getty Images Entertainment/Getty Images</p></figure><p>In an interview with Conan O'Brien in 2011, Snooki admitted that she uses (clean) <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>cat litter as an exfoliant</a>. "I definitely like to Google a lot, and I don't like to spend a lot of money on spa treatments," she explained. "So I Googled what else I could use [as an exfoliant], and it was cat litter." Conan was shocked but Snooki stood by it. "I haven't broke out at all, so... I think it works."</p><h3>4. Catherine Zeta-Jones' Beer Shampoo</h3><figure class="Qf5 E1M" readability=2><p>Ilya S. Savenok/Getty Images Entertainment/Getty Images</p></figure><p><a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Catherine Zeta-Jones washes her hair with beer</a> to make it silky soft, although she did admit to the <i>Daily Mail, </i>"I smell like the bottom of a beer barrel for days afterwards but it's very good for the hair."</p><h3>5. Suki Waterhouse's Cola Rinse</h3><figure class="Qf5 nbP" readability=2><p>Tristan Fewings/Getty Images Entertainment/Getty Images</p></figure><p>In an interview with <i>Us Weekly</i>, the British model espoused her love for this <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>American soft drink as a shampoo</a>, explaining, "I don't like my hair when it's washed — it's fine and limp — but Coca-Cola makes it tousled, like I've gone through the Amazon or something."</p><h3>6. Alessandra Ambrosio's Burned Hair</h3><p>The <a href=# class=T3D>Brazilian hair-burning technique velaterapia</a> is one that <a href=# class=T3D>Alessanda Ambrosio uses</a> to fight split ends. This is <i>not</i> something to be attempted by untrained hands though, because the risk is that your hair gets set on fire.</p><h3>7. Teri Hatcher's Wine Baths</h3><figure class="Qf5 nbP" readability=2><p>Jonathan Leibson/Getty Images Entertainment/Getty Images</p></figure><p>According to <i>The Black Book of Hollywood Beauty Secrets</i> by Kym Douglas and Cindy Pearlman, <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Teri Hatcher takes wine baths</a>. She dumps a cup of old red wine into the tub, letting the sediment sink to the bottom and then using it as an exfoliant. It sounds like a waste of perfectly good wine to me, but she might be onto something because there's now a <a href=# class=T3D>Japanese spa that offers public wine baths</a>.</p><h3>8. Lisa Rinna's Cinnamon Oil Lips</h3><figure class="Qf5 E1M" readability=2><p>Jason Kempin/Getty Images Entertainment/Getty Images</p></figure><p>Lisa Rinna is known for her oversized pout, and although she's had her fair share of surgical help, she has some advice for women who want the look at home. "A fun little trick if you want to plump up your lips, so to speak," <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>she said on <i>The Doctors</i> </a>, "is a little cinnamon. Just put a little on your lips."</p><h3>9. Cindy Crawford's Milk Spray</h3><figure class="Qf5 E1M" readability=2><p>INDRANIL MUKHERJEE/AFP/Getty Images</p></figure><p>ABC's <i>The Doctors </i>seems to be the place if you want to find out celebrities' strange beauty habits, because they did a segment on supermodel <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Cindy Crawford's beauty secret</a>: Spraying her face with a mix of whole milk and mineral water. The lactic acid in the milk apparently acts as a light exfoliant. You can also take it one step further than Crawford does and <a href=# class=T3D>bathe in milk</a>, but no results are guaranteed.</p><h3>10. Halle Berry's Coffee Scrub</h3><figure class="Qf5 nbP" readability=2><p>Jason Merritt/Getty Images Entertainment/Getty Images</p></figure><p>Allegedly, Halle Berry throws some <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>coffee grounds into her body wash</a> to help exfoliate. There is some science behind the madness though, because the caffeine in coffee can also help to tighten skin, and coffee grounds are biodegradable while <a href=# class=T3D>plastic microbeads</a>, a common component of many exfoliating body scrubs, are polluting waterways.</p><h3>11. Gwyneth Paltrow's Vagina Steaming</h3><figure class="Qf5 nbP" readability=2><p>Handout/Getty Images Entertainment/Getty Images</p></figure><p>When it comes to wacky beauty routines, Paltrow might be the queen. It's been reported that she loves everything from <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>snake venom face cream</a> to <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>vitamin IV drip therapy</a>, but the wackiest might just be <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>vaginal steaming</a>. On her blog Goop, Paltrow advocated for the <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Mugworth V-Steam at Tikkun Spa</a> in Santa Monica writing, "You sit on what is essentially a mini-throne, and a combination of infrared and mugwort steam cleanses your uterus, et al."</p><p>In the end, it all comes back to taking care of your vagina. No beauty routine is too wacky for that. Well, except maybe the snake venom thing.</p><p><i>Images: Getty Images (9)</i></p><p>Get Even More From Bustle — Sign Up For The Newsletter</p><p>From hair trends to relationship advice, our daily newsletter has everything you need to sound like a person who’s on TikTok, even if you aren’t.</p><p>More like this</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7o8HSraOeZpOkunCt0a2gnKSVqHxyfI9sbHFlYWZ6pLHLnpmroaSesrR51qKroWWnlrCsxYybnJqtpK56s7vUraCnnaNis7O7zGatmp%2BZo66tedKupZuZpJ22r7OMraZmr5mjsm6uwK2frA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./11-rain-ponchos-that-are-functional-actually-cute.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="11 Rain Ponchos That Are Functional &amp;amp; Actually Cute">&larr;
