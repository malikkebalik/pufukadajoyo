If the past few years have taught us anything, it’s the importance of spending time with your loved ones. There’s no better way to show appreciation for your mom this year than by learning about what makes her who she is. Asking your mom some fun, deep, light-hearted, and emotional Mother's Day questions is a great opportunity to get to know each other even better and spend time together rather than celebrating with (just) material items.</p><p>Sure, it's nice to surprise your mom <a href=# class=T3D>with a fun and practical gift</a>. But it's even nicer to attempt to get to know your mom as a real-life, actual person. It's easy to see <a href=# class=T3D>your mom</a> as just your mom and to forget that she had a life before she even knew you would exist. For many moms, the best Mother's Day gift is the chance to let their children get to know them so their bond can get stronger.</p><p>The other thing to consider here? One day your <a href=# class=T3D>mom won't be around</a>, and you won't get to ask any of this stuff. Take the chance to get to know your mom on a deeper level while you still have the chance — there are plenty of people who would do anything for that time. Now enough with the heavy stuff. This Mother's Day, buy a bottle of your mom’s favorite wine, sit outside and enjoy the springtime sun together, and talk. Here are 35 Mother’s Day questions to get you started.</p><h2>1. How did you meet Dad/Mom, and how did you know they were “The One?”</h2><figure class="Qf5 E1M" readability=2><p>Goodboy Picture Company/E+/Getty Images</p></figure><p>Obviously there are a ton of different family structures, but this one is a fun one to ask if your mom is in a relationship with your other parent. If you don't know about how your parents met, or have an idea of what their relationship was like before you came along, it can be super interesting to find out.</p><h2>2. Who was the first person you dated? What were they like?</h2><p>It may seem odd to think about your mom with other people, especially if your parents are married, but it can be enlightening and funny to hear about old dating days.</p><h2>3. What is the most rebellious thing you ever did in high school?</h2><p>Everybody was a reckless teenager once — even your mom. Give Mom a chance to reminisce!</p><h2>4. What's one thing you wish you did differently before you got married or had kids?</h2><p>This is where you start asking the hard-hitting questions.</p><h2>5. What is one thing about our relationship you wish you could change?</h2><p>If you want to build a stronger relationship with your mom, now is the best time to do it.</p><h2>6. What question do you wish you could ask your mom?</h2><p>After all, grandmothers usually know best.</p><h2>7. If you had all the money to do one thing right now, what would you do?</h2><p>Hey, who knows — maybe you two can try to make it happen together.</p><h2><strong>8. What is a goal you want to achieve in the next 10 years?</strong></h2><p>Your mom no doubt has ambitions and dreams too! You should care about them just as much as your mom cares about yours.</p><h2>9. What's the hardest thing about being a mom? What's the best thing?</h2><p>In case you want to get deep.</p><h2>10. If you could go back in time to one moment, what would it be?</h2><figure class="Qf5 E1M" readability=2><p>Zorica Nastasic/E+/Getty Images</p></figure><p>Mom's stories are always the best. Ask why this moment in particular means so much.</p><h2>11. What was your dream job when you were younger?</h2><p>It's so interesting to hear about what your mom wanted and envisioned for her life as a child.</p><h2>12. What do you wish you did differently when you were a new mom?</h2><p>Listen up — there are probably some lessons to be learned here.</p><h2>13. What do you miss the most about being a kid?</h2><p>This might make your mom cry.</p><h2>14. If we could do anything together, what would you want it to be?</h2><p>Then make it happen! Mother and child bonding time for real.</p><h2><strong>15. What was your life like before you had kids?</strong></h2><p>Get to know the side of your mother that existed before you came around. It's so rewarding. Maybe your mom has stayed very much the same, or maybe she has changed in some ways!</p><h2>16. What do you think are the most important qualities to look for in a significant other?</h2><p>Learn from others’ mistakes — chances are your mom learned a thing or two over the years.</p><h2>17. What was the biggest risk you have ever taken in your life? Do you regret it?</h2><p>This could be anything from financial risks to relationship risks. This will be a monumental moment from your mom’s life.</p><h2>18. Based on your experiences, what is the one thing that I should make sure to do before long-term commitment?</h2><p>Learn from your mom. Chances are you’ll want to take some advice on this one.</p><h2>19. What is a memory from your childhood that sticks with you?</h2><p>You can’t imagine your mom’s life without you in it, so learn a little about it.</p><h2>20. What moment in my life were you proudest of me?</h2><figure class="Qf5 E1M"><p>kali9/E+/Getty Images</p></figure><p>Break out the tissues for this one.</p><h2>21. In 10 years, where do you hope to see me in life?</h2><p>Your mom will most likely be proud of you for any future accomplishments.</p><h2>22. What is a beauty trick you swear by?</h2><p>Oh, so that’s how Mom stays so flawless.</p><h2>23. What was the hardest moment in your life? How did you overcome it?</h2><p>Learn a little something about overcoming challenges from one of the strongest people in your life.</p><h2>24. If you could change anything about the world, what would it be?</h2><p>It’s interesting to know what mom would choose to change if she had the resources to do so.</p><h2>25. What is the truest thing that you know?</h2><p>This question may seem odd, but Mom has been around a lot longer than you have and has probably seen a few things.</p><h2>26. Who was your biggest celebrity crush when you were younger?</h2><p>Follow up question: Who is your biggest celebrity crush now?</p><h2><strong>27. What was your life like when you were my age?</strong></h2><p>It’s always interesting to hear what your mom was up to when she was your age. You might even be surprised!</p><h2>28. What is the most memorable meal you’ve ever had?</h2><p>Everyone has that one meal that sticks out in their mind — the food, the atmosphere, and the location.</p><h2>29. Why did you decide to live in this city?</h2><p>Whether your mom stayed in the same place or moved somewhere new, pick her brain about why she chose this spot to settle down.</p><h2>30. What’s one skill you wish you were a master at?</h2><figure class="Qf5 E1M" readability=2><p>Hispanolistic/E+/Getty Images</p></figure><p>Find out what your mom might want to learn in the future.</p><h2>31. What masterclass could you teach?</h2><p>On the flip side of the previous question, every mom is a master at at least one thing. What’s your mom’s superpower?</p><h2>32. Where is the most beautiful place you’ve ever been and why?</h2><p>Maybe you can add this place to your bucket list so you can see what Mom is talking about.</p><h2>33. What is something you had as a kid that you wish you still had now?</h2><p>This one is a tough one for anyone to answer — there are so many things! Your mom’s answer to this one might surprise you.</p><h2>34. What is your most prized possession?</h2><p>What has your mom kept or newly acquired that means a lot?</p><h2>35. If you could go back and tell yourself at my age one thing, what would it be?</h2><p>Nothing compares to a mother’s advice. What she has to say to her former self might just apply to you too.</p><p>Get Even More From Bustle — Sign Up For The Newsletter</p><p>From hair trends to relationship advice, our daily newsletter has everything you need to sound like a person who’s on TikTok, even if you aren’t.</p><p>More like this</p><p>This article was originally published on May 8, 2015</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7o8HSraOeZpOkunC4yJ%2BcaHBha4Fyec6nZKanpJ2ys7%2BMnZiyZaGqsrTAyKilrGWkpHqiv8pmsKitomK6sLmMrKZmsZ%2BqerXDzmaamqZdl7Kku8yeZJykn6iys3nFq6CeppSo</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./beth-britt-jeff-hardy-s-wife-biography-age-wiki-height-weight-boyfriend-family-more.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Beth Britt (Jeff Hardys Wife) Biography, Age, Wiki, Height, Weight, Boyfriend, Family &amp;amp; More">&larr;
