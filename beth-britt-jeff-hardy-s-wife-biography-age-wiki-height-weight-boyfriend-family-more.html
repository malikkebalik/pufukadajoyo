She has been continuously supporting him in every way ever since and has often accompanied him to various events. She appeared on the media again in 2009 after her former partner was embroiled in a scandal over drugs.</p><p>She also graced gossip pages after the birth of her first daughter because of speculations about their relationship status before they finally got married in March 2011. Beth found herself with TNA owner Anthem in the midst of a legal dispute after the Hardy brothers quit the company in early 2017 and returned to WWE.</p><p>Anthem argued that the ‘Broken’ storyline and the Hardy children were their property as contractually everything produced by contract performers, including ‘intellectual property and assets because Anthem owns all of TNA.</p><p>It caused considerable uproar and when the two brothers were seeking legal aid, both Beth and Ruby fiercely attacked Anthem on social media. Many wrestling fans and influential people sided with the parents, which eventually forced Anthem to release the gimmick’s ownership in late 2017 and settle the issue.</p><p>Beth has been married to Jeff Hardy since the year 2011 and the couple is blessed with two daughters.</p><table width=604><tbody readability=4><tr><td>Boyfriends</td><td width=481>Jeff Hardy</td></tr><tr><td>Marital Status</td><td width=481>Married Since 2011</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Husband</td><td width=481 readability=5>Jeff Hardy<p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wikibio.us/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/download-38.jpg></p></td></tr><tr readability=7.5><td>Children</td><td width=481 readability=6><strong>Daughter –</strong> Ruby Claire Hardy (born October 19, 2010),<p>Nera Quinn Hardy (born December 31, 2015)</p><p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wikibio.us/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/images-10.jpg></p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>Here we provide you the list of Beth Britt’s favorite things.</p><table width=576><tbody readability=2><tr readability=4><td>Favorite Food</td><td width=350>Pizza, Chocolate Cake, and Hot Dog</td></tr><tr><td>Favorite Things To Do</td><td width=350>Visiting haunted places</td></tr></tbody></table><ul><li>Jeff and Beth Britt invested in expanding their capital in different businesses.</li></ul><ul><li>In the year 2009, Jeff was dropped from WWE.</li></ul><ul><li>And so, his life has been destroyed by drug addiction.</li></ul><ul><li>He later signed an impact-wrestling contract with TNA.</li></ul><ul><li>Jeff Hardy’s spouse has been followed in massive numbers on social media sites and, while sharing posts, she cutely adores her food love.</li></ul><ul><li>She visited the dark history museums and haunted houses.</li></ul><ul><li>Britt is a member of the paranormal association operating in the USA.</li></ul><ul><li>She has a passion for music, contemporary art, and fashion too.</li></ul><ul><li>She and her husband took part in the famous challenge of ice bucket pouring.</li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivmaC2o7XOZ6ysZ5Kawal5waugraxf</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./dan-tyminski-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Dan Tyminski Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth">&larr;
