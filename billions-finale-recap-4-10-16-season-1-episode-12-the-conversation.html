Wendy comes out of Soul Cycle and finds Axe waiting for her. He says he got her location out of her assistant and says he needs her to do something for him. He says she deserves this for that special season and hands her a car key.</p><p>She’s stunned at the luxury car and says thank you. It’s a Maserati. He says thanks and hugs her. He says he’s got to go meet Wags and says he has clarity now that he needed. Wendy says go get them and he takes off. She smiles and says the others might not be ready yet.</p><p>She checks out her new car. Lonnie comes to work and Chuck says he has a tip on Axe including bribery and payoffs. He tells him to go Greenwich and look for Mick Danzig. He says leave me out of this and call in Bryan when the time is right.</p><p>Wags is annoyed that Axe has him carrying a stack of notebooks when he says the info would fit on a flash drive. They meet with a board about the fund and the guy says Axe’s personal life is problematic. Axe says it’s all about his wife. The man says they have questions.</p><p>They pepper Axe with questions and he says he makes decisions to benefit a greater number of people. They walk out later and Wags calls him a lemon and says they just need one domino of an allocator. Lonnie takes subpoenas to Greenwich but won’t tell the guy in charge what he’s looking for.</p><p>Lonnie goes through duty records. Wags and Axe take a meeting and it looks like they might land one of the big fish they need but that fails. Axe says they have to nail Carter Staly. Chuck monitors as Lonnie grills a duty cop who has a lawyer.</p><p>Lonnie plays hard ball. Axe and Wags head into another meeting. Axe tells Wags to take the books and head back to the office. Wags leaves smiling. Axe pulls off his tie and jacket and heads into a shop then another meeting. He’s now in a hoodie and casual clothes.</p><p>Axe addresses the elephant in the room right away about the 9/11 stuff and the arrest. He says no one will give a shit about any of that in a year but they will eat themselves up over the growth they will miss out on. The guy says they can revisit it in a year. Axe says he won’t take his call in a year.</p><p>Axe says he’s going on the run of a lifetime and knows they know it. He says in 10 seconds the bullet train leaves. He says climb the f-k aboard if you want to make money. He comes back to Wags and the others celebrating him.</p><p>Lonnie goes to Bryan and says he found bribery of cops linked to Axe. He says he found some cops with suspected offshore accounts. Terri asks how he got onto this and he makes up a false lead that he looked into and a hunch. Bryan says some hunch.</p><p>Axe drives his car down the road and a cop pulls up behind him. He pulls over. He holds out his friend of the police card but it’s Raul. He tells axe he has a problem. He says he greased some fellows in his unit and now the US Attorney is poking around.</p><p>Raul says his guys are getting rolled over to get to the truth and says he’s got lots of relatives in Greenwich. Axe thanks him for being a friend and Raul says slow down on the winding roads around here. Axe wonders what to do next. He heads off.</p><p>Axe meets with Hall and Orrin and they tell him that this could screw him. He wonders how Chuck knows and says Danzig doesn’t even know how they did this. Axe asks Orrin to take off and he does then Axe says this is Wendy and says he had a session and was careless.</p><p>Hall says he can prepare the materials for Wendy and says Axe should stay normal with her so they can monitor her. Axe goes home and finds Lara pouring wine. He tells her to come outside and she follows him. They walk out into the backyard and he looks around cautiously.</p><p>He says she was right about Wendy and says he told her something compromising and it’s coming back on him. She says Wendy needs to be shut down tight. Axe says he will but the contingency plan needs to go into motion. Lara curses and asks if it’s really happening. He says yes.</p><p>Lara asks how he’ll play it and he says like nothing is wrong. Next day, Lonnie talks to Chuck about the case of obstruction of justice and Chuck is thrilled and says Axe will get real jail time. Bryan is there smiling. Chuck says excellent work and acts like it’s the first he’s hearing of it.</p><p>Chuck says what’s next and they talk. Wendy comes to see Axe and says so. He asks if that’s all she has to say to him. She looks perplexed and says she’s lost. He says he wasn’t going to say anything but seeing her smiling in his face, f-k it.</p><p>Axe says she sold him out. She asks what and he says he told her something compromising and now her husband is up his ass again. She shakes her head. Ae opens his safe and pulls out a folder. Axe says let me be clear then says if he goes down so will she.</p><p>He has her web traffic and says she has quite a dark side. It’s all the fetish stuff and says the whole world will know about her and Chuck’s sick predilections. Axe also has photos of the two of them naked in the hot bath together.</p><p>Axe says she must have known. Wendy insists she didn’t sell him out and says polygraph me mother f-ker. He says he told her about Danzig and within 48 hours, there’s an investigation. Wendy looks thoughtful then walks out.</p><p>Lara is with a realtor looking at out of the country properties near fine schools and asks if her children will be enrolled under their real names. He offers to get them all fresh passports but she says no thank you. The man says he knew he might do this for them one day.</p><p>He says she and the children don’t have to go and says you can’t come back from this. Lara says they’re all going together then says let’s talk about travel arrangements. Lonnie digs into a cheeseburger when Bryan shows up at the restaurant.</p><p>Bryan sits beside him and forces him to move over and Lonnie asks WTF. Bryan says he didn’t stumble upon this and says someone fed it to him. Lonnie says he has sources that sometimes come through. Bryan says the minute he walked in the door, one came through.</p><p>Lonnie says they can work together and share the win. Bryan says he knows Chuck gave it to him and got it somehow and is using Lonnie as his shill. Bryan says Lonnie will get hurt and he’s trying to protect him. Lonnie says no thanks then says address your issues with Chuck and stop dissing my integrity.</p><p>Lara meets with some pilots about leaving literally under the radar in a private plane. Wendy waits as Chuck comes home. He asks where are the kids and she says they are at Nancy’s so they can do this. He asks what is this.</p><p>Wendy says she knows what he did. Chuck says what he does is the best. Wendy says he broke into her computer, read her session notes and stole evidence. He says he had no choice but she says they all have choices. He says he’d do it again.</p><p>Wendy says don’t try your lawyer bullsh-t and he says it’s no worse than her having criminals as patients and says that’s the point. Chuck says he has all the proof he needs. Wendy says he can’t use privileged information and says she won’t lie for him.</p><p>He says a wife can’t be compelled to testify and she says she doesn’t have to be compelled, she’ll volunteer. She says he betrayed her trust and Chuck says she was out all night and saw her sharing a cigarette with Axe after a quick f-k.</p><p>She says he was spying and he says Axe is destroying their lives and driving them apart and doing it deliberately. She says no, Chuck is. She says the problem is here. He says it’s not that simple. He says even this conversation is about Axe.</p><p>Chuck says Axe won’t stop until he ruins him. She says he’s crazy. Chuck says Axe had him followed and she asks where and how. Chuck sits then says after he saw her with Axe, he was worked up and went to see Troy.</p><p>He says Axe had someone on him and if he wasn’t lucky, there would be pics in the paper today. Wendy is furious he went to see her without telling her. She’s furious. Chuck says he’s cut off from her. Chuck rants at her and she finally says her work gives her more than he does including honesty.</p><p>Chuck holds up her new car key and asks how she earned that. He says her conscience is dirty. Chuck says she’s a criminal too for being there in the midst of them. She says she’s taking a walk and tells him to pack his shit and he’d better be gone when she gets back.</p><p>Chuck packs a bag and walks out of his house. He walks slowly up the sidewalk. Lonnie comes to see Chuck the next day and finds him moving his bag – looks like he slept at his office. Lonnie says good news, they found the cops offshore accounts but the banks are not being cooperative.</p><p>Chuck says the case is terminated. Bryan, Terri, Kate and Lonnie are floored. They ask him what the f-k. He says it looked like a winner but it’s not. He says there is no smoking gun and never will be. He thanks Lonnie and says don’t chase another ghost.</p><p>Bryan is shocked and Lonnie says “It’s Chinatown, Jake” to Bryan. Kate looks shell shocked. Axe finds Wendy in his office sitting at his desk. He says he didn’t expect her back so soon. She plays him the recording she made of her talking to Chuck. She recorded an admission of his guilt.</p><p>Wendy nods her head and says it’s a helluva question Chuck asked her about working with criminals. He says he’s sorry he didn’t believe her and vows to shred all the documents he has. He says her bonus is $5 million but was going to be $2 million.</p><p>She says how does she know it’s not just $1 million plus $4 million invested there. He asks to buy the recording and she says he’s the father of her children. She presses delete on her phone. She sees the wire transfer email and says she quits.</p><p>She says she knows he traded on insider information or encouraged it or allowed it to happen. She says she can’t work there anymore. Axe says he can explain and she says good luck with that and walks out. Axe is stunned.</p><p>Wendy goes out to her Maserati with her box of stuff from her office. She looks back up at the office and then roars away in her new car. She smiles. Bryan gets a call from Orrin Bach. Chuck sits stewing in his office.</p><p>Chuck goes to Kate’s office and asks where Bryan is. She says he left. Chuck tells Kate to channel her anger then asks how she knew Tara was leaking information. She says she was just hovering and around. Chuck says she can’t be the only one and says pull all the personnel files and banking records.</p><p>Kate says got it. Axe goes home and down to the basement. He goes into the vault and finds Lara there. She says everything is set and they just need to get it to the plane. Axe says they don’t have to go. He says the leak was Wendy but not voluntarily and Chuck can’t act on what he knows.</p><p>Lara hugs him, relieved. She says she’s glad their boys don’t have to be fondue eaters. Axe says Wendy is gone for good. They look at their gold and stacks of cash. Lara says Wendy outlived her utility as a weather vane on Chuck then says she doesn’t want to talk about Wendy.</p><p>She looks at the cash and says it’s more than they ever thought they would have. She says she’ll take it back to the bank tomorrow but he says leave it here, you never know. Kate points out a janitor to Chuck who goes to talk to the surveillance guy about the wire at Axe Capital.</p><p>The guy he talks to is confused but it’s all for show for the janitor. Bryan meets Orrin at Bruno’s place and he orders them a pizza. Bruno hands Orrin the keys and says lock up when you’re done. Bryan eats and then asks now what.</p><p>Orrin says his boss got the bogus info on Axe by accessing his wife’s session notes. Bryan curses. Orrin says Chuck has probably dropped it by now and Bryan says he has. Orrin says just hang for a minute as Axe comes out of the back. Orrin tosses Axe the keys and goes.</p><p>Bryan says he can’t sit with him but Axe says he can and says it’s like looking at the lions at the zoo. Axe says Orrin is the smartest guy he knows and thinks Bryan is damned smart too. Axe talks about Chuck growing up with a silver spoon in his mouth.</p><p>Axe says he and Bryan grew up scrambling and worked hard to get everything they have. Axe talks about how Bryan’s drive is being thwarted working for Chuck. He says he’ll end up apathetic because of the environment he’s in.</p><p>Axe tells Bryan to work for Orrin Bach on his account. He says Bryan will never have to lie to himself and can win on his own terms. He says he’ll start with a seven figure base and can really help his family then mentions his struggling mom.</p><p>Bryan says he can’t picture it. Axe says he thinks he can picture it because he stayed and listened. Bryan says he stares at the lions at the zoo but doesn’t want to be one. Axe says everyone does but few get the chance and says that’s what he’s offering Bryan now.</p><p>Bryan thanks him for the pizza and stands. He walks towards the door and Axe says he didn’t hear no. Bryan walks out without ever saying no. Axe’s cell phone vibrates and Orrin says he heard from his source there are listening devices at Axe Capital.</p><p>Orrin says he’s sweeping. Chuck checks into a room at the club and is unhappy to hear no suites are available. He goes upstairs and sighs. He hears laughter from the next room and rolls his eyes. Chuck calls Wendy but gets voice mail.</p><p>A security team sweeps the office as Axe lurks in a doorway watching. They report to him that it’s all clear. Axe asks if they were thorough and the guy says they did every inch. Hall is there and says they can go deeper and Axe says go all the way down.</p><p>Chuck pulls files out of his bag and looks at the framed torn up check from the settlement conference. The security team tears up the carpet, walls and ceiling. They gut the offices. Hall and Axe help. The place is a wreck.</p><p>Hall says they went down to the rivets and nothing is there but then Hall says you can never be sure. Axe sits there later when Chuck shows up and mocks him for what he did to his office and says he never got a warrant to bug him.</p><p>Axe says a warrant never stopped him and Chuck says he came bearing gifts and hands him an envelope. Axe looks in it and sees the framed torn up check. Chuck says he wants him to have that as a reminder. Chuck says he’s not laughing and Axe says studies show laughter is healthy.</p><p>Chuck says his wife kicked him out and Axe says good for her then says she’s not there if he’s looking for her. He says they both lost her. Chuck says then maybe he has a sliver of his pain then says Axe stripped away everything from him.</p><p>Axe says you came at me and Chuck says you’re a criminal. He says it’s his job to put them away and Axe says he’s full of shit and isn’t good at his job. He says all he did was succeed and says all these rules are by politicians serving special needs.</p><p>He says the fines are just taxation by other means. Chuck says save the civics lesson. Axe says Chuck only takes cases he won’t lose then says industry and competition are what this country was built on. Chuck says maybe they’ll tell stories about him like Billy the Kid.</p><p>Chuck says Axe infects the world and throws the system off balance leaving chaos and poverty in his wake. Axe say she’s contributed hundreds of millions in taxes and philanthropy and employees hundreds. He says all Chuck does is feed off the municipality.</p><p>Axe calls Chuck a traffic cop and Chuck says that will play well with the other guys on his cell block and says Axe will end up in jail. He says that check is a reminder that was the best deal he’ll ever get from him and will wish like hell he took it.</p><p>Axe says when he pulls a deal off the table he’ll leave Nagasaki behind. Chuck says the only thing more dangerous than a guy with unlimited resources is a guy with nothing to lose and says that’s what Axe is looking at right here.</p><p>THE END!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmdoaKpxq2t1Kebq7FemLyue5FpaG9nkp65rbXOp6pmnpmjrq2xjKucnJmgYoFyfJBvZKydkai8r3mQZpypoaOksaZ5kGtkraCVYrCwutWeqayZpJ68r3s%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./brandi-glanville-was-so-f-ing-happy-when-lisa-vanderpump-left-the-show.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Brandi Glanville Was 'So F***ing Happy' When Lisa Vanderpump Left the Show">&larr;
