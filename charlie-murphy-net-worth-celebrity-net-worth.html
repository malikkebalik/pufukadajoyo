Their parents split when Charlie was five years old.</p><p>The Murphy brothers' father was tragically murdered in 1969, when Charlie was ten years old and Eddie was eight. Following their mother getting ill, Charlie and Eddie lived in foster care for a year. They were later raised in Roosevelt, NY, after their mother recovered and got remarried to Vernon Lynch.

Tragedy touched the Murphy family again when Vernon died of lung cancer.</p><p>Charlie spent ten months in jail as a teenager and enlisted in the Navy on the day of his release in 1978. He served for six years in the military as a boiler technician.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-334944 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/Charlie-Murphy-2.jpg alt="Charlie Murphy Net Worth" width=900 height=652 sizes="(max-width: 1504px) 100vw, 1504px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-334944 class=wp-caption-text>(Photo by Brad Barket/Getty Images )</p><h2 id=1980s-1990s-career><strong>1980s and 1990s Career</strong></h2><p>Murphy's career in show business began in the 1980s, appearing in bit parts in movies like Short Circuit 2.
