David died in June 2009 while he was in Bangkok, Thailand, filming a movie. His death was ruled accidental asphyxiation.</p><h2 id=early-life><strong>Early Life</strong></h2><p>David Carradine was born John Arthur Carradine Jr. on December 8, 1936, in Los Angeles, California. His parents, John and Ardanelle, divorced in 1944, and David had four half-brothers, <a href=#>Keith Carradine</a>, Bruce, <a href=#>Robert Carradine</a>, and Christopher.</p><p>Carradine was the uncle of actresses <a href=# title="Martha Plimpton Net Worth">Martha Plimpton</a> and Ever Carradine, and most of his half-brothers are actors as well. At age 5, David tried to hang himself after he found out that he and Bruce didn't have the same biological father (Bruce was Ardanelle's son from her first marriage, and John adopted him). He was saved by his father, who then confiscated and burned David's comic book collection.</p><p>After Carradine's parents split up, they battled over child custody and alimony, and after the divorce was settled, David moved in with his father, who was living in New York City. In 1967, David and John co-starred in a live telecast of "A Christmas Carol." Carradine spent a few years in reform schools, boarding schools, and foster homes before moving back to California. He attended Oakland High School, then he enrolled at Oakland Junior College. After his first year at Oakland Junior College, David transferred to San Francisco State College to study music theory and drama, and he wrote music for annual revues put on by the school's drama department. He eventually dropped out of college, and in 1960, he was drafted into the U.S. Army. Carradine drew pictures for Army training aids, and while he was stationed at Virginia's Fort Eustis, he formed a theatre company that was known as the "entertainment unit." During his time in the Army, David was court-martialed after he was caught shoplifting at a base grocery store, and he was honorably discharged in 1962.</p><h2 id=career><strong>Career</strong></h2><p>After leaving the Army, Carradine changed his first name to avoid being confused with his father. He made both his Broadway and film debuts in 1964, appearing in a production of Rolf Hochhuth's "The Deputy" and the Western movie "Taggart," and the following year, he performed on Broadway again, winning a Theatre World Award for Peter Shaffer's "The Royal Hunt of the Sun." In the '60s, David appeared in the films "Bus Riley's Back in Town" (1965), "Too Many Thieves" (1966), "The Violent Ones" (1967), "Heaven with a Gun" (1969), "Young Billy Young" (1969), and "The Good Guys and the Bad Guys" (1969), guest-starred on television shows such as "<a href=# title="Alfred Hitchcock Net Worth">Alfred Hitchcock</a> Hour" (1965) and "Ironside" (1968), and played the title role on the 1966 Western series "Shane."

He reprised the role of Bill in 2004's "Kill Bill: Volume 2," which was also a hit ($152.2 million) and earned Carradine several award nominations, including his fourth Golden Globe nomination.

At the time of his death, Carradine was filming the French movie "Stretch," which was released in 2011.</p><h2 id=personal-life><strong>Personal Life</strong></h2><p>David was married five times. He wed Donna Lee Becht, his high school sweetheart, on Christmas Day in 1960, and they welcomed daughter Calista in April 1962. After they divorced in late 1967, Carradine began a relationship with his "Heaven with a Gun" co-star <a href=# title="Barbara Hershey Net Worth">Barbara Hershey</a>, and the couple had a son, Free (who later changed his name to Tom), in 1972. David and Barbara split up after he began an affair with actress <a href=# title="Season Hubley Net Worth">Season Hubley</a> in the mid-'70s. Carradine married Linda Gilbert on February 2, 1977, and they had daughter Kansas in 1978. David and Linda divorced in October 1983, then he married Gail Jensen on December 4, 1986. The two were married until early 1997, then Carradine wed Marina Anderson on February 20, 1998. When Marina filed for divorce, she claimed that David engaged in "abhorrent and deviant sexual behavior which was potentially deadly," and she later published a book entitled "David Carradine: The Eye of My Tornado." The divorce was finalized in December 2001, then Carradine married Annie Bierman, on December 26, 2004. They remained together until David's death in 2009, and he was stepfather to Amanda, Madeleine, Olivia, and Max, Annie's children from her two previous marriages.</p><p>In the late '50s, Carradine was arrested for assaulting a San Francisco police officer. He was arrested for marijuana possession in 1967 and 1980 and for malicious mischief and attempted burglary in 1974. In the 1974 incident, David broke into a neighbor's house while he was naked and high on peyote, and he allegedly assaulted a woman who later sued him for $1.1 million (she only received a $20,000 settlement). Carradine was arrested for D.U.I. in 1984 and 1989, and the second time, he was sentenced to "three years' summary probation, 48 hours in jail, 100 hours of community service, 30 days' work picking up trash for the California Department of Transportation, attendance at a drunk driving awareness meeting and completion of an alcohol rehabilitation program." In 1994, he was arrested before a Rolling Stones concert at Toronto's SkyDome for kicking in a glass door at the venue. According to a SkyDome spokesman, "His side of the story was that he was worried about getting swarmed by people who recognized him so he wanted to get into the building."</p><h2 id=death><strong>Death</strong></h2><p>At age 72, Carradine was found dead on June 3, 2009, in his hotel room at Bangkok's SwissÃ´tel Nai Lert Park Hotel. According to a police official, David was found naked and "hanging by a rope in the room's closet."</p><p>Though many speculated that Carradine had died by suicide, after two autopsies were performed, it was concluded that his cause of death was "accidental asphyxiation." Photo's of David's body at the scene of his death as well as autopsy photos were printed in newspapers and circulated on the internet, causing outrage and an FBI probe.</p><p>Carradine's funeral service took place 10 days after his death, and he was buried in a bamboo casket at Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Los Angeles. His grave marker is engraved with the phrase "The Barefoot Legend" and the lyrics "I'm looking for a place where the dogs don't bite and children don't cry and everything always goes just right and brothers don't fight," which are from his song "Paint."</p><p>A year after David's death, his widow, Annie, filed a wrongful death lawsuit against MK2 Productions, the company that was producing the movie Carradine was filming in Bangkok at the time of his death. The lawsuit alleged that the assistant the company provided David "left him behind for dinner on the night before the actor was found dead. The assistant and other film staffers apparently could not reach Carradine and decided to leave without him. Carradine called the assistant an hour later but was told the group was across town, and he would have to make his own arrangements that evening." The lawsuit was settled in August 2011, and Annie received $400,000 from the production company.</p><h2 id=awards-nominations><strong>Awards and Nominations</strong></h2><p>In 1973, Carradine earned a Primetime Emmy nomination for Outstanding Continued Performance by an Actor in a Leading Role (Drama Series â€“ Continuing) for "Kung Fu."
