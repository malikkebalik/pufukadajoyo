For his higher education, Miller enrolled at Point Park University, and graduated in 1976 with a degree in journalism.</p><h2 id=early-career><strong>Early Career</strong></h2><p>Unable to find journalism work after college, Miller took several odd jobs, including as a deli clerk, janitor, ice cream scooper, and florist delivery man. Following these stints, he worked at Point Park's Recreation Room, where he managed the bowling alley, video games, and air-hockey league. In 1979, after watching <a href=# title="Robin Williams Net Worth">Robin Williams</a> perform comedy on HBO, Miller finally decided to follow his dream of becoming a stand-up comic.</p><p>Miller began his comedy career performing at open-mic nights in Pittsburgh, Castle Shannon, and Oakland. During this time, he lived without a car or much money. Eventually, he saved enough money to move to New York City, where he lived in a tiny bunker-like apartment. Miller earned recognition in the Big Apple after a joke he submitted to a Playboy magazine contest ended up tying for second place, winning him $500. He gained even greater attention performing in the New York Laff-Off Contest, drawing the interest of talent agents.</p><h2 id=success><strong>Success</strong></h2><p>In the early 80s, Miller returned to Pittsburgh and made a transition to television.

The hour-long politics-oriented program featured a chimpanzee "consultant" named Ellie, who was soon replaced by a smaller chimp named Mo.
