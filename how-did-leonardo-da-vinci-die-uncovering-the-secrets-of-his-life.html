He was an Italian polymath of the High Renaissance who was active as a painter, draughtsman, engineer, scientist, theorist, sculptor and architect. But he left us unexpectedly and in this post, you will get all the information related to his death.</p><h2>What is Leonardo Da Vinci’s Cause of Death?</h2><p><strong>Leonardo Da Vinci died at Clos Lucé on 2 May 1519 possibly of a stroke.</strong> Vasari states that in his last days, Leonardo sent for a priest to receive the Holy Sacrament.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/venturejolt.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Untitled-design-3.jpg><p>Vasari also says that the king held Leonardo’s head in his arms as he died, but this story might just be a story and not a fact. His will said that sixty beggars carrying candles should follow Leonardo’s coffin.</p><p><strong>Leonardo’s body was buried in the Collegiate Church of Saint Florentin at the Chateau d’Amboise on August 12, 1519. </strong>This much is known about Leonardo Da Vinci’s death and below you can read about his life.</p><h2><strong>In Which Age Did Leonardo Da Vinci Die?</strong></h2><p>Leonardo da Vinci son of Ser Piero from Vinci was born on April 15, 1452, in or near Vinci, a hill town in Tuscany that is 20 miles from Florence and <strong>passed away on 2 May 1519 at the age of 67 years.</strong> Both of his parents were still together a year after Leonardo was born. After that, they decided to split up and married separately.</p><p><strong>Below we provided our other posts related to Ryan Leone & Florine Mark’s cause of death:</strong></p><h2><strong>Where Did Leonardo Da Vinci Work?</strong></h2><p>He first became famous for being a painter but he is also well known for the drawings and notes he kept in notebooks. These notebooks had information on anatomy, astronomy, botany, mapping, painting and paleontology.</p><p>Many people think that Leonardo was a genius who embodied the Renaissance humanist ideal. His body of work has had an even bigger impact on later artists than that of his younger colleague Michelangelo.&nbsp;The Italian painter and sculptor Andrea del Verrocchio taught him in Florence.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/venturejolt.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Leonardo-Da-Vinci.jpg><p><strong>His first job was in the city, but he then worked for Ludovico Sforza in Milan for a long time.</strong> Later, he worked again in Florence and Milan and for a short time in Rome. During this time, he had a lot of students and people who tried to copy his work.</p><p>He spent his last three years in France, where he died in 1519. Since he died, his accomplishments, wide range of interests, personal life and scientific thinking have never failed to interest and inspire people. This has made him a popular cultural figure and namesake.</p><p><strong>It is thought that Leonardo was one of the best artists ever and he is often called the founder of the High Renaissance.</strong> He made some of the most important drawings in Western art, even though many of his works have been lost and only 25 major works have been identified.</p><h2><strong>Which is Leonardo Da Vinci’s Most Famous Picture?</strong></h2><p><strong>The Mona Lisa is his most famous picture and is often thought of as the most famous painting in the world.</strong> His drawing of Vitruvius Man is also seen as a cultural icon and The Last Supper is the most copied sacred painting of all time.</p><p>It is thought that Leonardo painted Salvator Mundi in whole or in part. In 2017, it was sold at auction for US$450.3 million, making it the most expensive painting ever to be sold at a public sale.</p><p>He came up with ideas for flying machines, a type of armored fighting vehicle, concentrated solar power, a ratio machine that could be used in an adding machine and the double hull. <span>He was admired for his scientific brilliance.</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/venturejolt.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Untitled-design-4.jpg><p><span>Few of his designs were built or even possible during his lifetime because the Renaissance was not yet the time when modern scientific methods of metalworking and engineering were being developed.&nbsp;</span><span> A machine for testing the tensile strength of wire and an automated bobbin winder were two of his smaller ideas that didn’t get much attention when they were put into use.</span></p><p><span>In anatomy, civil engineering, hydrodynamics, geology, optics and tribology, he made important discoveries. However, he didn’t publish them and they didn’t have much of an effect on science afterward.</span></p><p>For more information related to these kinds of more topics, you can <a href=# rel=noopener>follow us on Twitter</a> and check out our other latest posts.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiulaPBtr7Eo6alrF6YvK57kWlpbGdhZXxzfY6hprBllJ6xbrjEqKWaqpSkeqWtjK%2Bgp5uZYrGqsY4%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./how-mark-harmon-s-role-in-st-elsewhere-was-groundbreaking-in-the-80s.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="How Mark Harmon's Role in 'St. Elsewhere' Was Groundbreaking in the '80s">&larr;
