If you grew up in the 70s and 80s, odds are you grew up on PBS.&nbsp; Before Noggin, Nickelodeon, Nick, Jr, and STARZ Kidz, the go-to channel for children's educational programming was the Public Broadcasting Service.&nbsp; PBS aired a series of shows that were required viewing for elementary to early high school age kids, including "<strong>Sesame Street</strong>", "<strong>The Electric Company</strong>", "Picture Pages", "<strong>3-2-1 Contact</strong>", "Square One TV", "<strong>Mister Roger's Neighborhood</strong>", and a little show about reading, called "<strong>Reading Rainbow</strong>". &nbsp;Reading Rainbow was an educational program with a fairly simple premise – reading a book and exploring the themes and ideas in that book –&nbsp; "<strong>Reading Rainbow</strong>" was on the air for over 20 years.&nbsp; It ended its run in 2006, and went off the air completely in 2009.&nbsp; In May of 2014, a crowd-funding campaign to reboot the series set a Kickstarter record, wracking up <strong>105,857 backers</strong>, and the aforementioned $6.5 million.&nbsp; So why did a simple show about books, that hadn't even aired for five years, crowd-fund its way into history?&nbsp; Read on…</p><p class=p1>"Reading Rainbow" began airing on PBS on June 6, 1983, though the pilot was actually shot a full two years earlier.&nbsp; For those of you who never watched the show, a person – usually a celebrity, read a children's book.&nbsp; Then host LeVar Burton, took the viewer on a journey to explore the world of the book, showing the ways the events portrayed in the book related to real life.&nbsp; At the end of each episode, he would give a brief summary of the book, and then kids would give their own reviews of the book.&nbsp; The series went out of its way to feature a wide variety of books, showing the breadth of children's literature.&nbsp; The program was almost instantly popular.&nbsp; With a jazzy theme song sung by Tina Fabrique, the early use of synthesizers, and an oh-so-cool animated opening sequence, kids used to tune in just to bop around their living rooms to the opening credits.&nbsp; Different corporate sponsors underwrote each episode, and the program became a sign of corporate responsibility, before CR was even a buzz term.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-234132 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/LeVar-Burton.jpg alt width=594 height=413 sizes="(max-width: 594px) 100vw, 594px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-234132 class=wp-caption-text>Craig Barritt/Getty Images</p><p class=p1>Having <strong>LeVar Burton</strong> as host didn't hurt either.&nbsp; <a href=#>LeVar Burton</a> was born in Landstuhl, West Germany, on February 16, 1957.&nbsp; His father was stationed on the Army Base there.&nbsp; He went on to grow up in Sacramento, California, and was originally focused on a life in the church.&nbsp; However, he left seminary when he was 17, and instead snagged a drama scholarship at the University of Southern California.&nbsp; He graduated with a BFA in Theatre, and set off to become a professional actor.&nbsp; His first audition out of college, was for a mini-series called "<strong>Roots</strong>".&nbsp; He booked the job, playing the lead character, Kunta Kinte.&nbsp; The series, and its sequels, had a major impact on American consciousness.&nbsp; His work netted him an Emmy nomination and almost instant fame.&nbsp; Following "Roots", he went on to a busy acting, producing, and directing career that continues to this day.&nbsp; He has a healthy net worth of $6 million.&nbsp; He is currently co-starring on the series, "<strong>Perception</strong>", and voices Doc Greene on "Transformers: Rescue Bots".&nbsp; He has also become a respected tech and science commentator, and regularly speaks at tech and science conventions around the world.</p><p class=p1>While acting became LeVar Burton's career, he was also still invested in the things that had mattered to him when he was training to be a priest – primarily educational initiatives.&nbsp; In the late 70s and early 80s, around the same time that he was becoming a household name in "Roots", he was invited to host a show on PBS called "Rebop".&nbsp; In 1981, he was tapped to work on another PBS program that would become "Reading Rainbow".&nbsp; He agreed to host and to serve as an executive producer.&nbsp; <a href=# title="Gene Roddenberry Net Worth">Gene Roddenberry</a> subsequently invited him to join the cast of "<strong>Star Trek: The Next Generation</strong>" as Lieutenant Junior Grade <strong>Geordi La Forge</strong>.&nbsp; The show began airing in 1986, and it not only brought him more fame, it brought more attention to his other role, as host of "Reading Rainbow".</p><p class=p1></p><p class=p1>"Reading Rainbow" went on to earn an amazing number of awards, including a Peabody Award and<strong> 26 Emmy Awards</strong>.&nbsp; 11 of the Emmy Awards were for "Outstanding Children's Series".&nbsp; LeVar Burton won a combined 12 Emmys – some for producing and some as host.&nbsp; The program was nominated for many, many more honors.&nbsp; However, PBS ran into severe financial woes during the early 2000s, as their funding was drastically cut.&nbsp; After airing for 22 years, it seemed like it was finally going to be pulled from PBS' regular line-up.&nbsp; Five new episodes were shot in 2006, and then it continued to air in reruns until 2009.&nbsp; Then it was gone.&nbsp; Generations of viewers mourned the end of an era as LeVar Burton said his last, "We'll see you next time".</p><p class=p1>Though the program stopped airing, it was clear that it was still an indelible part of the public conscious.&nbsp; It was often referenced popular culture – being mentioned in books, quoted on television shows, and occasionally parodied.&nbsp; LeVar Burton was most often greeted by fans, not with quotes from "Roots" or "Star Trek", but by loud, unapologetic renditions of the "Reading Rainbow" theme song.&nbsp; Many people pointed to the show as being the reason they loved reading.&nbsp; The program had had exactly the impact the entire production team had hoped for.</p><p class=p1>In 2010, LeVar Burton's own production company, <strong>RRKIDZ</strong>, began working on a way to bring the series back in some form.&nbsp; He owned the rights to the show, and knew that it still had merit.&nbsp; In 2012, he and his business partner, Mark Wolfe, launched the "Reading Rainbow" <strong>iPad app</strong>.&nbsp; Like the show, the app was an almost instant success.&nbsp; It took only thirty-six hours for it to become the <strong>#1 educational app</strong>.&nbsp; As of January 2014, just 18 months after its official launch, children had read <strong>10 million books</strong> through the app, and it is still at #1.</p><p class=p1></p><p class=p1>In May of 2014, LeVar Burton announced that he and his business associates were going to launch a Kickstarter campaign to support a new version of "Reading Rainbow".&nbsp; They wanted to create a "Reading Rainbow" interactive program to be used in classrooms that would be free to schools in need.&nbsp; The new version would be available on multiple platforms, rather than just iPad and Kindle, and would include a version specifically for teachers and web-version for use at home. Their goal was to reach <strong>$1 million</strong> in a month. A lot of people scoffed at the viability of that goal. LeVar and Reading Rainbow reached $1 million in <strong>11 hours</strong>.&nbsp; They hit $2 million the next day.&nbsp; By the end of their 35 day campaign, they'd raised <strong>$5,408,916</strong>. &nbsp;When the fundraiser ended, Family Guy creator&nbsp;<strong><a href=#>Seth MacFarlane</a></strong>, personally&nbsp;pledged a matching donation of $1 million. A handful of&nbsp;other business people and individuals chipped in another <strong>$70,000</strong> in non-Kickstarter donations.&nbsp; At the end of their campaign, they'd earned <strong>$6,478,916</strong>.&nbsp; They ended up collecting the fifth largest amount of money in the history of&nbsp;Kickstarter.&nbsp; With <strong>105,857</strong> individual backers, they now hold the record for the most number of backers ever. By a long shot.</p><p class=p1>Taking everything in to account, it's fairly easy to see understand why the "Reading Rainbow" Kickstarter campaign set records.&nbsp; Between a show that had an incredibly positive impact on 20 years of children, a host that is loved and respected by a huge number of fans, and an educational model that actually works, the campaign was destined to be a success.&nbsp; However, no one realized how much of a success it would be. &nbsp;As the numbers climbed higher, LeVar Burton and his colleagues were clearly blown away by the outpouring of support.&nbsp; You have to admit, amidst all the ugly things going on in the world, seeing something worthy get the support it needs to grow, is pretty awesome.&nbsp; Here's hoping the new "Reading Rainbow" can have the same positive impact on another 20 years of kids!!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue8Crq6KbnJrAcLHNrZyrrJGeu66xza1kmqqknrCtsdJonZqun6e2tbGMrZylnaaewKq7zWaqoaenYriqsIyjrKysXaKupbGMb2RuZZ2eua21zqdkoaGjqbyzxY4%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./what-happened-to-tupac-shakur-s-sister-sekyiwa.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="What Happened To Tupac Shakur's Sister, Sekyiwa?">&larr;
