Marques Colston is best known for his illustrious career with the New Orleans Saints in the National Football League (NFL). During his time with the Saints, Colston became one of the most productive and reliable receivers in the league, setting numerous records and helping his team win the Super Bowl. However, his path to NFL stardom was far from easy.</p><h2 id=business-empire><strong>Business Empire</strong></h2><p>Marques Colston is also <a href=#>known for his savvy business acumen</a>, investing in several successful ventures in and outside of football. He has owned shares of the Harrisburg Stampede of the American Indoor Football League and the Philadelphia Soul and Albany Empire of the Arena Football League. He is also an early investor in a compression apparel startup called Enerskin.</p><h2 id=early-life><strong>Early Life</strong></h2><p>Marques E. Colston was born on June 5, 1983, in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. Growing up, Colston was a multi-sport athlete who excelled in football, basketball, and track and field. Despite his athletic prowess, Colston was largely overlooked by college scouts and accepted a scholarship to Hofstra University, a small Division 1-AA school in New York, after turning down the University of Missouri.</p><p>In college, Colston quickly established himself as one of the top receivers in the country, setting numerous school and conference records. However, his small-school pedigree and lack of exposure caused him to slip to the seventh round of the 2006 NFL Draft.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-201262 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/GettyImages-492243898.jpg alt="Marques Colston" width=594 height=430 sizes="(max-width: 594px) 100vw, 594px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-201262 class=wp-caption-text>Rich Schultz /Getty Images</p><h2 id=nfl-career><strong>NFL Career</strong></h2><p>Despite being selected with the 252nd overall pick in the seventh round of the 2006 NFL Draft, Colston wasted no time making an impact in the NFL. In his rookie season with the Saints, he caught 70 passes for 1,038 yards and eight touchdowns, earning him a spot on the All-Rookie team.</p><p>Over the next nine seasons, Colston continued to establish himself as one of the top receivers in the league, becoming the Saints' all-time leader in receiving yards, touchdown catches, and receptions. He helped lead the Saints to a Super Bowl victory in 2010 with their 31-17 win over the Indianapolis Colts.</p><p>Despite his success on the field, Colston was often overshadowed by other high-profile receivers in the league. He was known for his quiet and unassuming demeanor, choosing to let his play speak for itself.</p><p>In 2019, Colston was inducted into the New Orleans Saints Hall of Fame. In 2021, he was enshrined into the Louisiana Sports Hall of Fame.</p><h2 id=contracts-amp-career-earnings><strong>Contracts & Career Earnings</strong></h2><p>Over the course of his 10-year career, Colston signed several lucrative contracts with the Saints.
