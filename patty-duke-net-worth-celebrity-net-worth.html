Her mother forced her father to leave the family home when Duke was six. When she was eight, her care was turned over to John and Ethel Ross. The couple managed the careers of a number of child actors, including Duke's older brother. The Rosses mistreated Duke throughout her early career, as their methods were exploitative and dangerous.

The couple divorced in 1969.</p><p>In early 1970, Duke was involved with three men at the same time â€“ <a href=#>Desi Arnaz Jr</a>., <a href=#>John Astin</a>, and Michael Tell. In June of 1970, she learned she was pregnant. She quickly married Tell during a manic phase. Their marriage lasted only 13 days before ending in an annulment in July.</p><p>Her son, Sean Astin, was born in February 1971. Duke initially told her son that Arnaz Jr. was his father.

Her third book, "In the Presence of Greatness â€“ My Sixty Year Journey as an Actress," was published posthumously in February 2018.</p><p>Duke died on March 29, 2016 in Idaho at the age of 69.
