Mosley was born on December 18, 1938, in LA. His mother’s name is <strong>Eloise Harris, </strong>but his father’s name is not known to the general people. Other than this, there is no information on any of his siblings, whether they existed or not.</p><p>He belongs to African-American ethnicity and also holds American nationality. His horoscope is Sagittarius.</p><h2>Age and Body Measurements</h2><p>Roger was born in 1938, which makes him 80 years as of now. He stands at the height of 6’1,” but his weight is not known to the general people. At his peak, he had a very fit body that tends to match his weight as well.</p><h4><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Daniela Rajic Bio, Parents, Boyfriend, Career, Net Worth, Wiki</a></h4><p>Other than this, his vital body statistics are not available, and he has beautiful black eyes, and his hair color also tends to resemble the same black color.</p><h2>Early Life and Education</h2><p>Roger was born in LA and spent most of his childhood there. There is the least legit information about his father and siblings, so we feel he received his mother’s love, and more or less father didn’t play a much more significant role in his life.</p><p>Mosley went to&nbsp; David Starr Jordan High School education complex for his studies and did pretty well there. There is no more information on his further studies, so we feel that he concentrated more on his acting than studies.</p><h2>Roger E. Mosley Career</h2><p>As most of the artist struggle to find their feet in the industry and take longer to make a big explosion. The same was not the case of Roger. Mosley’s career was full of success from the very beginning. Roger’s debut came in the year 1971 when he was part of the series Terminal Island.</p><p>His role was highly appreciated in the series. His memorable movies include the likes of Night Court, Baretta, Sanford and Son, Kojak, etc. His is an outstanding actor, and his films have made high numbers at the box office. His successful ventures include the likes of Hickey and Boggs, The Jericho Mile, Pentathlon, Letters from a Killer.</p><h4><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Staci Keanan Bio, Now, Age, Height, Movies, Net Worth, Instagram</a></h4><p>Besides all of his acting credentials, he is also a good writer who has given numbers to remember for the audience. He is also the founder of the Watts Repertory Company. This suggests the fact the Roger was a pretty multi-talented individual who has given his contribution to lots of departments of the entertainment industry.</p><h2>Wife</h2><p>Roger E.Mosley is a married man as of now. He is married twice in his whole life. The first marriage of the man came way back in 1960. Surprisingly there is no information on how the couple met, who the lucky girl is, and does they bore any kids. Later both of them made ways for each other.</p><p>After being divorced from his first wife, he found the perfect match. Recently he is married to <strong>Toni Laudermick</strong>. Both of them are together since 1976, but no information is out in the open about how did they meet and when is the exact date of tying the knots took place.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/tvshowstars.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/roger-815.jpg><p>It is quite astonishing that such a legendary individual has most of his information under the radar with such ease. Both Toni and Roger share three children, and like all other information, their names are also kept silent.</p><p>There is no news of any rift in the relationship, and they enjoy their own company to the highest level. Likewise, they have no extramarital affair news up until now.</p><h2>Roger E. Mosley Net Worth</h2><p>Yes, this may be one of the highly wanting to know the topic of this man. Roger is a multi-talented individual who has worked hard for all of his ways. His estimated net worth stands at <strong>$3 million</strong>. As most of our readers might not know, but he is retired from acting since 2014.</p><h4><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Allison Wardle Age, Height, Career, Husband, Net Worth, Wiki-Bio</a></h4><p>The net worth provided is an estimation, so we feel that he is hiding the actual amount from the prying eyes. His mansion, or be it the cars are also in the dark.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmispqi1sMPSrZirq16YvK570aienqpdmnquu9KlnLJlkZyybrTEop6hrF2YrrOxxKtksKGWmnqstcOsZKedpGLEsL7ToWY%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./the-man-the-myth-and-the-legend-simu-liu-apparently-didn-t-have-the-it-factor-for-crazy.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="The man, the myth and the legend Simu Liu apparently didnt have the it factor for Crazy ">&larr;
