After her parent’s divorce in 2010, Adlon lived with her mother and sisters. As for her nationality, Adlon holds both American and German citizenship. And it seems young Gideon comes from a Jewish family.</p><p>Moving on to her education, Gideon studied photography at Columbia College Chicago for a year before dropping out to be an actress. Also, during her high school days, Adlon took part in the slam poetry competition and even reached the finals.</p><h2>How old is Gideon Adlon?- Age and Height</h2><p>Despite gaining nine years worth of experience in the entertainment industry, Gideon Adlon is just in her early 20s. The American actress was born on March 30, 1997, which makes her 23 years old at the moment.</p><p>Not to mention, Adlon’s star sign happens to be Aries, who are known for being fierce, passionate, and extroverted individuals.</p><p>However, it is not only her screen presence that attracted many people, but it is also her unmatched beauty. The young Adlon has gorgeous features such as her brown eyes and long brown hair. Added to that, Gideon has got slender physique measuring 32-25-34 inches.&nbsp;</p><p>Also, she is 5 feet tall and weighs 52 kgs. Being an actress and veteran, Gideon knows a bit about looking good in front of the camera.</p><h2>Gideon Adlon dropped out of college to pursue acting.</h2><p>Born and raised in a talented family involved with the entertainment business, Gideon was definitely inspired by them to be an actress. Even if she did not pursue acting, she must have surely done something related to it. Anywho, young Adlon dropped out of her college to pursue acting full-time.</p><p>And since she came from a film-related family, they must have supported her decision as well. Hence, in 2011, young Gideon made her professional acting debut from the comedy-drama series Louie. She appeared in an episode alongside her mother, Pamela.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/tvshowstars.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/gideon-002.jpg><p>Likewise, Adlon then made her guest appearance in the Disney Channel sitcom Girl Meets World back in 2016, followed by another comedy-drama series titled Better Things. The following year, Gideon starred in a different genre than she was used to. She was seen in the ABC miniseries When We Rise and another CBS crime drama series, Criminal Minds.</p><p>Apart from that, young Adlon also appeared in the ABC anthology crime drama series, American Crime. Slowly but definitely, the actress was making a name for herself while also learning the trades of entertainment.</p><h4><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kathryn Newton Age, Height, Supernatural, Movies, Net Worth, Instagram >></a></h4><p>Finally, Adlon’s hard work paid off when she garnered much fame for her work in the 2018 movie, Blockers. In this American sex comedy directed by <strong>Kay Cannon</strong>, the actress portrayed the role of <strong>Sam Lockwood</strong>. As expected, the movie received a lot of positive reviews and was a box office success.</p><p>After that Gideon started appearing in more challenging yet acclaimed movies. The year later of Blockers, Adlon starred in another critically acclaimed drama film titled The Mustang. Here she fulfilled the role of <strong>Martha Coleman.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Her stardom was further elevated to the international level from the Netflix mystery teen drama series, The Society. In this thrilling and mysterious series, Adlon impressed the viewers with her portrayal of <strong>Becca Gelb</strong>. Judging by the success of the show, everyone was anticipating the follow-up season.</p><p>Sadly, the second season was canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic, even though the second season was confirmed. Because of it, the show suffered a huge loss.</p><p>Nonetheless, Adlon made her presence again on-screen from the horror sequel movie, The Craft: Legacy released on October 28, 2020. Furthermore, young Gideon is set to star as Claire in the horror fantasy film Witch Hunt.&nbsp;</p><h2>Is Gideon Adlon dating anyone?

Stoimenov</strong>, a Bulgarian native.

Despite the exposure, the two have maintained a certain level of secret from the prying eyes of media and the public alike. It may be as Boris is not a celebrity or involved in the entertainment industry in any way.</p><p>Other than that, Gideon seems to be close to her family as well.</p><h2>Net Worth and Income- How much is Gideon Adlon’s worth?</h2><p>Active as an actress and model, the gorgeous Adlon’s schedule is always packed.
