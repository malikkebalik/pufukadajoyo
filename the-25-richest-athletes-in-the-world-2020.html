Tiger Woods, Floyd Mayweather, Michael Jordan… I'm sure you can guess some of the top names, but who has the highest net worth as of April 2020?</p><p>Here's a quick spoiler/surprise: The person who has historically been the richest athlete in the world is a retired Romanian tennis player you've never heard of and wouldn't recognize if you bumped into him on the street. That Romanian tennis player, Ion Tiriac, was the first billionaire athlete in history. He is still a billionaire, but no longer rich enough to be #1 on this list.</p><p>So who grabbed the top slot? Let's take a look at the top 25 richest athletes on the planet:</p><h2><strong>#25: Grant Hill Net Worth: $250 million</strong></h2><p>Hill began his NBA career in 1994 with the Detroit Pistons. He went on to play for teams including the Orlando Magic, the Phoenix Suns and the Los Angeles Clippers, retiring after the 2013 season. During his lengthy NBA career, Grant earned $140 million in salary alone and another roughly $120 million from endorsements. This includes a seven-year $80 million deal with Fila, which was the largest shoe contract in history up to that point. He continued his partnership with Fila with a lifetime deal in 2018 that will pay him upwards of $10 million per year.</p><h2><strong>#24: Gary Player Net Worth: $250 million</strong></h2><p>One of the most respected PGA golfers, Player is the third most winning golfer in the history of the PGA. His net worth is largely tied to his business interests, which are exclusively represented by Black Knight International. His business ventures include his work as a golf course architect, as well as licensing, events, publishing, wine, apparel and memorabilia. Black Knight International also handles all of his endorsements and merchandising activities. Additionally, over the course of his career he has pledged $100 million to the underprivileged in his home country, South Africa.</p><h2><strong>#23: Lewis Hamilton Net Worth: $285 million</strong></h2><p>Between June 2016 and June 2017, Hamilton earned around $50 million from endorsements and prize money. Between June 2017 and June 2018, he earned $51 million.

He also has an ongoing partnership with fashion label <a href=# title="Tommy Hilfiger Net Worth">Tommy Hilfiger</a>, releasing several capsule collections with the brand.</p><h2><strong>#22: George Foreman Net Worth: $300 million</strong></h2><p>Very little of Foreman's net worth actually comes from boxing. After turning professional in 1969 and winning 76 out of 81 fights, by the 1980s his net worth was still a relatively small $5 million. The majority of his net worth comes from his various business ventures, including most notably the grill that bears his name. Other goods he has promoted include Meineke mufflers and the <a href=# title="George Foreman Net Worth">George Foreman</a> Lean Mean Fat Reducing Grilling Machine, and he is also a partner in the Panther Racing Indy Car team.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-296857 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/George-Foreman.jpg alt="George Foreman Net Worth" width=900 height=655 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-296857 class=wp-caption-text>Cathrin Mueller/Bongarts/Getty Images</p><h2><strong>#21: Dale Earnhardt Jr. Net Worth: $300 million</strong></h2><p>At the peak of his career Dale earned $25 -30 million per year.

During his career, he earned $441 million in baseball salary alone and signed several contracts that were the largest in sports history at the time. At his peak he earned $33 million per year in salary. Outside of sports, Rodriguez is a real estate investor through his A-Rod Corp.</p><h2><strong>#17: Vinnie Johnson Net Worth: $400 million</strong></h2><p>Johnson, a retired professional basketball player, spent his career playing for the Seattle SuperSonics, the Detroit Pistons, and the San Antonio Spurs, before retiring in 1992. During his career, he spent over a decade playing with the Pistons, winning two championships with them. After retiring from the NBA, he founded Piston automotive, which is now one of the largest auto parts suppliers in America. The company employs more than 200 people and generates more than $2 billion per year in revenue.</p><h2><strong>#16: Shaquille O'Neal Net Worth: $400 million</strong></h2><p>During his professional basketball career, O'Neal played with the Orlando Magic, Los Angeles Lakers, Miami Heat, Phoenix Suns, Cleveland Cavaliers, and Boston Celtics. Notable contracts of his include a seven-year $121 million deal he signed with the Lakers, and his five-year $100 million contract with the Miami Heat.

In a given year he earned around roughly $60 million, of which $10 million came from salary and tournament winnings and an astonishing additional $50 million in endorsements.&nbsp;His biggest endorsements are with KPMG, ExxonMobil, Titleist, Ford, Enbrel, Callaway, Amgen, Grayhawk, Rolex and Intrepid Financial Partners. He has earned more than $700 million off the golf course from endorsements during his career, which means he has earned around $900 million in total during his career as of 2020.</p><h2><strong>#14: Lionel Messi Net Worth: $400 million</strong></h2><p>Argentinian-born professional footballer earned his net worth as the striker and winger of the FC Barcelona, and the Argentinian National Team.

He had a notable but somewhat under-the-radar career. For nine consecutive seasons he averaged double figures in scoring. He holds the Milwaukee franchise record for number of games played at 711, though he only started in 105 of those games. His peak salary, $350,000, came in 1985 from the Clippers. After leaving the NBA, on a whim Junior bought a Wendy's franchise. He slowly expanded over the next few years, building out what would become Bridgeman Foods Inc. Fast forward a few decades and Junior owns more than 160 Wendy's and 120 Chili's franchises, employing more than 11,000 people.

Michael earned $1 billion in salary and endorsements during his illustrious career.</p><h2><strong>#4: Magic Johnson Net Worth: $600 million</strong></h2><p>Former professional basketball player Johnson played for the Los Angeles Lakers for 13 seasons.

His main sources of revenue are tournament winnings and product endorsements. His earnings of $118 million on the golf course amount to 7.6% of his total career earnings, but his endorsements account for 92.4% of his earnings. He has endorsed brands such as Nike, Gatorade, American Express, Rolex, Gillette, Tag Heuer, and Buick. Just his Gatorade deal was worth $100 million over 5 years, and between 1997 and 2005 he earned $140 million from Nike endorsements.</p><p>As of this writing <a href=#>Tiger Woods' net worth</a> is $800 million. And that's AFTER he paid ex-wife Elin a $100+ million divorce settlement.</p><h2><strong>#2: Ion Tiriac Net Worth: $1.2 billion</strong></h2><p>Romanian former professional tennis player Ion Tiriac had a very respectable career in the late 70s and early 80s. After winning 22 career titles as a doubles player and being ranked #19 in doubles tennis, he retired and became a coach for players like Ilie Năstase and, most importantly, Boris Becker. Ion orchestrated Boris Becker's ascent to become the #1 ranked player in the world. Working with Boris in early 90s Germany exposed Ion to western business practices that would soon sweep the former USSR.</p><p>In 1990 Ion established Banca Tiriac. It was Romania's first private bank. He then went on to launch retail businesses, auto dealerships, an airline and an insurance company. He also owns a large residential and commercial real estate portfolio. Today his empire includes Tiriac Holdings, TiriacAIR, HVB Tiriac Bank, Allianz-Tiriac Asigurari Romania, TiriacAuto, Tiriac Leasing, and Tir Travel.</p><p>He first became a billionaire officially in 2007. Ion Tiriac's personal fortune ultimately peaked at over $2 billion. That was more than enough to make him the richest athlete in the world for the last decade. Unfortunately over the last few years, and in recent months in particular, Ion's fortunes have been hit by a number of business headwinds, reducing his net worth to $1.2 billion as of this writing. At the same time, Michael Jordan's fortunes have soared…</p><h2><strong>#1: <a href=#>Michael Jordan Net Worth: $2.2 billion</a></strong></h2><p>Michael Jordan was the first athlete to earn over $30 million per year in salary. When he earned $33.14 million from the Chicago Bulls for the 1997-1998 season, that was the same as earning $53.4 million in today's dollars. He "only" ever earned a total of $93 million in NBA salary. As you know, he has also earned an enormous sum of money through endorsement deals with companies like Hanes, Gatorade, McDonald's, Upper Deck, MCI and many more. But it was his Nike Air Jordan partnership that has earned Michael a truly stunning amount of money, even nearly two decades after he retired from sports professionally. Every year to this day he earns $80-$100 million in Nike shoe royalties. In total Michael has earned at least $1.4 billion from endorsements before taxes to date.</p><p>But even after earning $1.5 billion from salary and endorsements, Michael wasn't done building his empire. In 2006 he bought a minority stake in what was then known as the Charlotte Bobcats. The team changed its name to the Charlotte Hornets in 2014, the same year Michael paid $175 million for a majority ownership stake in the team. His stake was just under 90%. At this time the Hornets overall were worth at least $600 million. After team debt was removed and his other assets were included, Michael officially achieved billionaire status for the first time,</p><p>In 2019 he sold a minority portion of his stake to a group of hedge fund managers at an overall team valuation of $1.5 billion. Immediately after this transaction closed, Michael's net worth was $1.9 billion.</p><p>As of April 2020, Michael Jordan's net worth is $2.2 billion.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-296860 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Michael-Jordan.jpg alt="Michael Jordan Net Worth" width=900 height=650 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-296860 class=wp-caption-text>(Photo by Alex Wong/Getty Images)</p><h3><strong>*** Kobe Bryant ***</strong></h3><p>As we all know, Kobe Bryant tragically died on January 26, 2020 in a helicopter crash at the age of 41. At the time of his death, <a href=#>Kobe Bryant's net worth was $600 million</a>. If he were still alive today, Kobe would be one of the five richest athletes on the planet.</p><p>During his career Kobe earned $328 million in salary alone and $350 million from endorsements for a total of $680 million. He was also an early investor in a sports drink company called Bodyarmor. He purchased a 10% stake in the company in 2014 for $6 million. In 2018 Coca Cola &nbsp;purchased a stake in Bodyarmor that valued the company as a whole at $2 billion. That meant Kobe's $6 million investment was worth $200 million, on paper, before taxes.</p><h3><strong>Who Was The Richest Athlete In History?</strong></h3><p>So does Michael Jordan's $2.2 billion fortune make him the richest athlete in human history? Technically no. Not by a long shot. That accolade belongs to a Roman charioteer named Gaius Appuleius Diocles who lived in 104 AD. Diocles raced for nearly a quarter-century, finally retiring at age 42. He won 1,462 out of the 4,257 races he competed in. Diocles's pay was five times that of the wealthiest provincial governors of the same era. His earnings were also enough to provide grain for the entire city of Rome for a full year or pay every single soldier of the Roman Army at the strongest point of its imperial reach for more than two months.</p><p>Over the course of his career, Diocles reportedly won 35,863,120 sesterces. Adjusted for inflation, his total winnings would equal&nbsp;<b>$15 billion.</b></p><p>So Michael still has something to shoot for! He just needs to make another $12.8 billion. If anyone can "just do it"… it's Michael Jordan.</p><h3><strong>Summary</strong></h3><p>As of April 2020, Michael Jordan is the richest athlete in the world with a net worth of $2.2 billion. He's followed by retired Romanian tennis player turned financier Ion Tiriac who is worth $1 billion. These are the 10 richest athletes in the world as of 2020:</p><ul><li>#1 Michael Jordan $2.2 billion</li><li>#2 Ion Tiriac $1 billion</li><li>#3 Tiger Woods $800 million</li><li>#4 Magic Johnson $600 million</li><li>#5 <a href=# title="Michael Schumacher Net Worth">Michael Schumacher</a> $600 million</li><li>#6 <a href=# title="Roger Staubach Net Worth">Roger Staubach</a> $600 million</li><li>#7 Floyd Mayweather $505 million</li><li>#8 LeBron James $480 million</li><li>#9 Eddie Jordan $475 million</li><li>#10 Cristiano Ronaldo $460 million</li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue8Crq6KbnJrAcL%2FPqKmtq12jsri%2Fjq2fnmVianqztcKhnKysXZbBqbjErZysZZmjerW0xGauqKqcmXpzfJFpZg%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./kris-kristofferson-weight-gain-before-and-after-photos.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Kris Kristofferson Weight Gain  Before And After Photos">&larr;
