Indeed, the tale of a gang of friends on the hunt for One-Eyed Willy's treasure not only endures as a reminder of a seemingly bygone era of movie-making, it also stirs up old feelings for those who haven't quite forgotten what it was like to be an adventurous adolescent.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Here's what the ragtag crew from Oregon's Goon Docks is up to these days:</p><h2 data-node-id=4 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Sean Astin (Mikey)</h2><img alt="Mikey Sean Astin" title="Mikey Sean Astin" width=1920 height=1280 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/the-goonies-sean-astin.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-eqbp25 eewc14j2">Photo: Alamy; JB Lacroix/WireImage</span><p>Sean Astin as Mikey in ’The Goonies’; Astin in 2018</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">The son of Oscar-winning actress Patty Duke, Sean Astin set his own impressive screen career in motion with his film debut as the lead of the Goonies. He went on to star in the action-thriller Toy Solders (1991) and as the ultimate football underdog in Rudy (1993), before finding his sidekick niche with the role of Samwise Gamgee in The Lord of the Rings trilogy in the early 2000s. Along with his subsequent directing and voice-over work, and his appearances in series such as Stranger Things, Astin has competed in numerous marathons and promoted fitness through his #RUN3rd Twitter campaign.</p><h2 data-node-id=9 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Josh Brolin (Brand)</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Another offspring of Hollywood royalty — dad James Brolin appeared in Pee-wee's Big Adventure the same year as The Goonies — <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/josh-brolin data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Josh Brolin" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Josh Brolin</a> showed his future leading man chops with his performance as protective big brother Brand. But the ascent to A-list status was not an immediate one, as the actor turned to <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/20/movies/josh-brolin-avengers-deadpool-sicario.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="day trading" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">day trading</a> in 2002 to supplement his income. It wasn't until 2007-08, when he stood out in high-profile features like No Country for Old Men, W. and Milk, that Brolin became a big-time bankable star. He followed with headlining roles in Oldboy (2013), Inherent Vice (2014) and Sicario (2015), though his intimidating glower left him best suited for villainous roles in comic-book-inspired blockbusters like Avengers: Infinity War (2017) and Deadpool 2 (2018) and Avengers: End Game (2019).</p><h2 data-node-id=11 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Corey Feldman (Mouth)</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Already an industry veteran by the time he played the troublemaking, Spanish-speaking Mouth, Corey Feldman became one of the top child stars of the era with his wisecracking characters in <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/movies-tv/stand-by-me-cast-where-are-they-now data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Stand By Me" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Stand By Me</a> (1986), <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/movies-tv/the-lost-boys-cast-where-are-they-now data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="The Lost Boys" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">The Lost Boys</a> (1987) and License to Drive (1988). But the transition to adulthood proved turbulent, as Feldman was arrested for heroin possession in 1990 and struggled to get his career back on track. He eventually went the reality show route with The Surreal Life in 2003, and four years later, he joined fellow troubled former child star <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/corey-haim data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Corey Haim" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Corey Haim</a> for The Two Coreys.

But he soon left his acting career behind to focus on academics and, after graduating from the UCLA School of Law, he went into entertainment law, co-founding Cohen Gardner LLP in 2002. While no longer eligible for showbiz awards like an Oscar, Cohen earned industry acclaim with his mention in <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://variety.com/gallery/showbiz-strategists-variety-dealmakers-impact-report/jef-cohen-head-shot/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Variety's Dealmakers Impact Report" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Variety's Dealmakers Impact Report</a>.

After appearing in later seasons of Head of the Class and 1992's Encino Man, Jonathan Ke Quan disappeared from American screens. He went on to reinvent himself as a stunt coordinator for films like X-Men (2000) and <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/jet-li data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Jet Li" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Jet Li</a>'s The One (2001), before attempting an acting comeback two decades later with projects like Finding Ohana.</p><h2 data-node-id=18 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Kerri Green (Andy)</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Kerri Green followed her big-screen debut as the cheerleader Andy in The Goonies with roles in Summer Rental (1985) and the acclaimed Lucas (1986), seemingly setting the stage for a substantial film career. But stardom wasn't meant to be for the New Jersey native, who made scattered appearances in shows like Mad About You and Murder, She Wrote after attending Vassar College. Green kept her foot in the industry by forming the Independent Women Artists production company, and she later directed the teen pregnancy film Bellyfruit, featuring a young Michael Peña, in 1999. Green has since largely remained out of the public eye, save for her role in the 2012 film Complacent and her appearance with Astin at the 2017 New Jersey Horror Con and Film Festival.</p><h2 data-node-id=20 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Martha Plimpton (Stef)</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Already busy as a model and actor by the time she was cast as Andy's BFF and Mouth's chief antagonist, Martha Plimpton continued drawing attention with follow-up films such as The Mosquito Coast (1986) and Running on Empty (1988). She also appeared in several indie flicks through the 1990s and cemented her reputation as a serious actress with performances in Hobson's Choice and Coast of Utopia the following decade. Plimpton has also enjoyed success on the small screen, from her starring roles in the sitcoms Raising Hope and The Real O'Neals to her 2012 guest Emmy win for The Good Wife, and has advocated for reproductive rights as a co-founder of the nonprofit organization A is For.</p><h2 data-node-id=22 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">John Matuszak (Sloth)</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Beneath the deformed features and mounds of makeup that went into the creation of Sloth stood the 6-foot, 8-inch John Matuszak. A former top NFL draft pick, Matuszak won two Super Bowls as a defensive lineman with the Oakland Raiders, along the way appearing in the popular football flick North Dallas Forty (1979). A full-time turn to acting saw him rack up credits in films like The Ice Pirates (1984) and One Crazy Summer (1986), and he followed with his autobiography, Cruisin' with the Tooz, in 1987. Sadly, The Goonies' fan-favorite <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/06/28/sports/matuszak-s-death-caused-by-accidental-overdose.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="died in 1989" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">died in 1989</a> from a prescription drug overdose.</p><h2 data-node-id=24 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Anne Ramsey (Mama Fratelli)</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=25 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">A longtime stage actress, Anne Ramsey began finding steady work in television and film in the 1970s. However, it was her performance as the tough-as-nails villain Mama Fratelli that sparked a late-career renaissance, leading to an Academy Award-nominated role as the overbearing matriarch of Throw Momma from the Train (1987). Ramsey <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1988-08-13-mn-2-story.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=succumbed class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">succumbed</a> to throat cancer in 1988, but the recent acclaim had made her a sought-after actress to the very end, as underscored by her appearances in Doctor Hackenstein, Scrooged and Homer and Eddie, which were released in the months after her death.</p><h2 data-node-id=26 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Robert Davi (Jake Fratelli)</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=27 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">The part of Jake Fratelli was just one in a <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=http://davisingssinatra.com/bio/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=string class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">string</a> of tough-guy roles for Robert Davi, who played drug lord Frank Sanchez in the 1989 <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/movies-tv/james-bond-actors data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="James Bond" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">James Bond</a> film License to Kill and later appeared in Predator 2 (1990), Showgirls (1995) and The Iceman (2012). He also featured prominently in the late 1990s crime drama Profiler and, in an unsurprising move to anyone who listened to him sing throughout The Goonies, released an album of <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/musicians/frank-sinatra data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Frank Sinatra" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Frank Sinatra</a> standards in 2011. Davi has also hosted a podcast and been involved with the Heart of a Child Foundation and the Humane Society of the United States, but he never strays too far from his screen roots, as illustrated by his performance as famed gangster Vito Genovese in 2019's Mob Town.</p><h2 data-node-id=28 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Joe Pantoliano (Francis Fratelli)</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=29 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">The other half of the scary but comically inept Fratelli brothers, Joe Pantoliano has carved out an impressive <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/im-not-guys-first-choice-how-joe-pantoliano-built-a-career-edges-1269559 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=career class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">career</a> as one of Hollywood's most recognizable character actors. He followed The Goonies with appearances in Midnight Run (1988), The Fugitive (1993) and Bad Boys (1995), before closing out the decade with the blockbuster The Matrix (1999), and nabbing an Emmy in 2003 for his performance as Ralphie Cifaretto in The Sopranos. Along with returning to his popular cop buddy franchise with Bad Boys For Life in 2020, "Joey Pants" has sought to erase the stigma surrounding mental illness through the publication of two revealing memoirs and the founding of a nonprofit, <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=http://www.nkm2.org/page/3 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="No Kidding?
