In this post, you will learn about him and the things that he did in his life.</p><h2><strong>Who is Icy Wyatt?</strong></h2><p><strong>Wyatt Yeager is a popular TikTok user who is also known by his fandom as Icy Wyatt.</strong> On TikTok, he has 1.3 million fans following him at <a href=# rel=noopener>@IcyWyatt</a>. He was born in Torrance, California on July 4th.</p><p>He writes about his daily activities such as his favorite shoes, his interactions with family and friends, his pets and his travel destinations. Additionally, he frequently publishes films in which he requests that his viewers “come eat with me.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/venturejolt.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Icy-Wyatt-2.jpg><p>In these videos, Yeager demonstrates takeout food he recently got from fast food restaurants like McDonald’s and Subway before assessing it as he consumes it. Before opening the paper bags containing his food, he is renowned for vigorously tapping them.</p><p>Around a week ago, <a href=# rel=noopener>he updated his TikTok channel with a video</a> of what he could appear to be like as an elderly man that was probably made with age progression software.</p><p>The words “when you find out you’re going to jail and gonna look like this when you get out” were layered on top of the footage. In the below paragraphs, you will read why he was arrested.</p><p><strong>If you want to know about the other persons who were arrested you can check out our below posts:</strong></p><h2><strong>When and Why Did Icy Wyatt Go to Prison?</strong></h2><p><strong>Icy Wyatt was arrested in March 2022.</strong> <a href=# rel=noopener>Body cam video</a> of the altercation was posted and quickly became popular. In the video, “TikTok Star Is Convinced That Laws Don’t Apply To Him” police officers are shown responding to 911 calls regarding an altercation in a Chick-Fil-A parking lot.</p><p>Officers find the TikTok celebrity who had made his own 911 call outlining his account of the events after witnesses describe what they witnessed. He said in the video:</p><p>“I had four guys jump out the car and say ‘we’re going to beat the f*** out of you and stuff. They didn’t hurt me because I have a gun.”</p><p>Police then appear in the footage pinning Wyatt to the ground and taking him into custody. Additionally, a witness video of the celebrity’s reckless driving is shown.</p><p><strong>On March 28, 2022, Yeager was taken into custody on two counts of aggrἀvated assἀult with a dangerous weἀpon,</strong> one count of aggravated battery with a deἀdly weἀpon, one count of vἰolence on an officer and one count of resisting arrest.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/venturejolt.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Icy-Wyatt-4-1.jpg><p>This was a result of an incident in which he was “erratically” driving a pink Mercedes through Florida’s West Sunrise Boulevard when he suddenly halted. Yeager is said to have been told to leave by two individuals and a dispute ensued when he followed them into a nearby parking lot.</p><p>The social media star allegedly threatened the two individuals who had asked him to relocate his car after that and then pulled a revolver from his vehicle. After that, Yeager is alleged to have shot one of the victims in the back of the head.</p><p>He was caught by officers and arrested and Yeager allegedly kicked an officer in the thigh while acting vἰolently during his detention.&nbsp;The online sensation disputed the accμsations on Twitter after the confrontation. <a href=# rel=noopener>He said in a Tweet</a>:</p><p>“Police in Broward County ambushed me in my neighborhood hours after I had called for help in road rage incident earlier in the day. They didn’t send anyone to help me but came to my house hours later and help me at gun point. This is not okay.”</p><p><a href=# rel=noopener>He also wrote</a>:</p><p>“I was the victim! This was in self-defence. The alleged assaμlt on the officer was after I was already apprehended and will be dropped after I get the body cam footage.”</p><p>Wyatt was rearrested related to this case. As of yet that much information is revealed related to this case.
