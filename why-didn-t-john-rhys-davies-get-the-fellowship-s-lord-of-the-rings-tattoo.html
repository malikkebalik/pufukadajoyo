For the cast and crew, the making of the movies was an extraordinary experience, and a handful of the principal characters got matching tattoos to commemorate. However, one actor in particular declined, with another lesser-known individual stepping up to take his place.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=244 data-current-count=244 data-injectable=false>According to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Variety</a>, despite the epic nature of the project, the whole trilogy was filmed in one go, from Oct. 11, 1999, through to Dec. 22, 2000, taking 438 days in total. In addition, there were pick-up shots that were done in 2001 and 2002.</p><p data-characters=337 data-current-count=581 data-injectable=true>Though <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the cast</a> wasn’t always on set at the same time, the intensity of what they went through bonded them, and they decided to commemorate that bond with a tattoo of the Sindarin (Elvish) word for nine, to represent the nine members of the Fellowship: Frodo, Samwise, Merry, Pippin, Legolas, Aragorn, Boromir, Gandalf, and Gimli.</p><p data-characters=335 data-current-count=335 data-injectable=false>All but one of the actors got the tattoo, with John Rhys-Davies, who played Gimli, instead passing on the task to someone equally as worthy. When asked why he didn’t get the tattoo Rhys-Davies joked, “You really think I want to have my lovely skin broken by a dirty needle? Good God. No,” according to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">ComicBook.com</a>.</p><p data-characters=173 data-current-count=508 data-injectable=true>What many people don’t know is that a lot of what they see of Gimli on-screen is actually Brett Beattie, Rhys-Davies’ stunt double and unsung hero of the films.</p><h2 id=h-how-john-rhys-davies-avoided-getting-the-lord-of-the-rings-tattoo data-injectable=false>How John Rhys-Davies avoided getting the Lord of the Rings tattoo</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image-126.png><h3 id=h-how-did-rhys-davies-get-transformed-into-a-dwarf data-injectable=false>How did Rhys-Davies get transformed into a dwarf?</h3><p data-characters=432 data-current-count=732 data-injectable=true>Due to the fact that Rhys-Davies is actually 6 ft 1 in, a lot taller than a dwarf should be, and also had skin issues when it came to the vast amount of facial prosthetics required, they used Beattie as his stunt double and size double. With a black belt in martial arts and experience with horse riding, as well as standing at 4 ft 10″, Beattie was a great fit for the role, even if he was a little green in terms of acting.</p><p data-characters=120 data-current-count=120 data-injectable=false>In an interview with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Polygon</a>, Beattie discusses how instead of using CGI to make Gimli look short, he was used instead.</p><p>“I am aware that a lot of the people, even hardcore Lord of the Rings fans, assume that a lot of the shots are some tricky sort of camera angle or some CGI shrinking John Rhys-Davies down. I don’t want to burst anyone’s bubbles, but I can only think of a couple of shots where CGI was used to shrink Rhys-Davies down.”</p><p data-characters=267 data-current-count=267 data-injectable=false>The interview confirmed that Beattie spent 2,300 hours, or 189 days, as Gimli, which almost earned him the credit as Gimli’s stunt, size, and photo double, but was sadly told that due to “movie politics” he would be credited only as a stunt double.</p><h3 id=h-how-did-this-preparation-affect-him data-injectable=false>How did this preparation affect him?</h3><p data-characters=254 data-current-count=521 data-injectable=true>Though he didn’t wish to cause an issue, he was crushed by this given how much time he had put into the character. This isn’t even mentioning the physical toll it took on him as he blew both his knees filming the Battle of Helm’s Deep.</p><p data-characters=160 data-current-count=160 data-injectable=false>Of the incident, Beattie says, “The surgeon was asking me how I got those injuries, and I was like, ‘Well, I was battling Uruk-hai at Helm’s Deep.’”&nbsp;</p><h2 id=h-was-rhys-davies-asked-to-get-the-tattoo data-injectable=false>Was Rhys-Davies asked to get the tattoo?</h2><p data-characters=397 data-current-count=557 data-injectable=true>Despite this and other near misses, including an axe to the face, avoiding horse hooves, nearly sinking the canoe, and dealing with the nightmare that is prosthetics, many still don’t recognize him for his contribution to the character and films. The other principal cast members, however, wanted to include him in their commemorative act and invited him to join them in getting the tattoo:</p><p>“I remember Elijah Wood actually approached me first and invited me. And to tell you the truth, my biggest concern at the time was John Rhys-Davies. I knew that this wasn’t supposed to be for me to be asked to get this tattoo. So I said I had to think about it.”</p><p data-characters=309 data-current-count=580 data-injectable=true>The next day he was approached by <a href=#>Orlando Bloom</a> (Legolas) and Viggo Mortensen (Aragorn), who again encouraged him to join them, and he agreed. So the Fellowship, sans Rhys-Davies and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Sean Bean</a> (who was back in London and got his tattoo done separately), headed to a tattoo parlor in Wellington and got inked.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Orlando Bloom (@orlandobloom)</a></p></figure><p data-characters=329 data-current-count=629 data-injectable=false>Nowadays Beattie doesn’t show off his tattoo very often, but is proud of the work he put into the film saying, “I knew I’d done something harder than I’d ever done in my life, and I knew I’d never work that hard again.” He still takes the odd stunt job but focuses on his native tree farm in Canterbury.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJorqGxXZm2pbrTZqGooJ5iv6nF0mabmq6ZmsBus8StZK2glWKzprjLqK6soJmlwG64zqubZqeWYsGpsYyroKefo2LBosDTqKZo</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./sister-wives-kody-brown-pays-off-coyote-pass-property-who-owns-the-land.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="'Sister Wives' Kody Brown Pays off Coyote Pass Property: Who Owns the Land?">&larr;
